# Path to crawl data from zhihu.com

This repo is my record of learning web crawler and data mining techniques.


NOTE: Since zhihu.com has been chaning their front-end app frequently, my current Scrapy boosted spider is not working anymore... As a legacy of this project, I used D3.js to draw a simple user's network graph. 

   To see the graph, download index.html and followers.json, then initialize a naive HTTP server (something in your terminal like: $ python3 -m http.server), then in your browser go to:  localhost:8000.
   
   I plan to restart this project someday in 2017... bye
