# Path to crawl data from zhihu.com

This repo is my record of learning web crawler and data mining techniques.

# File info:

> learn_spider.py and utils.py give birth to my first trivial spider...
    
> doubanMovie.py is the second spider which crawls data from movie.douban.com. Some of the idea come from @plough's repo.

> doubanMonve_db.py is powerd by MongoDB's python API --- pymongo. Data are stored in JSON format in database.
